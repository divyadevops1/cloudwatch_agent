Step-by-step Installation of CloudWatch Agent on Ubuntu
1. Download the CloudWatch Agent package
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent/ubuntu/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
2. Install the .deb package
sudo dpkg -i -E ./amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
3. Create the CloudWatch Agent configuration file
You can use the wizard (interactive CLI) to generate a configuration file:

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
Alternatively, you can create your own JSON config and save it to:

/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json
Example config (basic metrics + logs):


4. Start the CloudWatch Agent

sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
  -a fetch-config \
  -m ec2 \
  -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json \
  -s
5. (Optional) Enable it to start on boot

sudo systemctl enable amazon-cloudwatch-agent
üìù Notes:
Ensure your EC2 instance has a proper IAM role with CloudWatch permissions (e.g., CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy).

You can monitor logs as well by including a logs section in your config.
