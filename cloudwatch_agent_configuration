sudo yum install -y amazon-cloudwatch-agent

(optional) If you plan to kick off exports or other AWS operations from the instance itself, install the AWS CLI v2:

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install


Verify with
aws   - –version

On Amazon Linux 2 (and many modern distro-by-default), system logs go into the journal, not into /var/log/messages. If you want to have a traditional /var/log/messages file, you need to install and enable a syslog daemon (rsyslog or syslog-ng) that writes out to it.


Install rsyslog

sudo yum install -y rsyslog

Enable & start the rsyslog service

sudo systemctl enable rsyslog
sudo systemctl start rsyslog




Verify /var/log/messages appears
ls -lh /var/log/messages
# and tail a few lines:
sudo tail -n 20 /var/log/messages
You should now see new log entries there. From this point on, configuring the CloudWatch Agent to watch /var/log/messages will work out-of-the-box.

IT WOULD SHOW ALREADY INSTALLED
sudo yum install amazon-cloudwatch-agent -y

Create the CloudWatch Agent Configuration File
You can create the config using the wizard:
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard

	Do you want to monitor any log files?
1. yes
2. no
default choice: [1]:
Log file path:
/var/log/messages
Log group name:
default choice: [messages]
newcwagent
Log group class:
1. STANDARD
2. INFREQUENT_ACCESS
default choice: [1]:

Log stream name:
default choice: [{instance_id}]

 Start the Agent
Start the agent with the config file:
bash
CopyEdit
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl \
  -a fetch-config \
  -m ec2 \
  -c file:/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json \
  -s

✅ Check Status
To see if the agent is running:
bash
CopyEdit
sudo /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-ctl -m ec2 -a status
